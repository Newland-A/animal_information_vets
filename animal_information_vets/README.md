## Welcome Veternarians and Owners
This web application was created as a tool for veternarians to see the owners they have and be able to add information about the pets their owners have. For the owners it was creaeted to see information on their pets from the vet. Many more features too come welcome to contributions and suggestions. Thank you for taking the time to look through it. 

## Installation

To install Sinatra, just use gem to install the package.

```
gem install sinatra
```
Some Linux distributions have a package already created for Sinatra. You might be able to install using your Linux package manager. For example:

# Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install ruby-sinatra
```
# Fedora
```
sudo dnf install rubygem-sinatra
```
## Usage

First it starts you out on the signup page. Then, it will redirect you to login. Once, logged in you can add your pet to your database. Then, you will be able to see all of your pets information and be able to edit the pet's info. If this pet no longer exists because it was sold or has passed away you can delete this pet from your database.
